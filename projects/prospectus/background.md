## General Idea

In finance, a prospectus is a document that describes a security to potential
investors and contains information about the security's costs, objectives,
risks and performance.  The goal for this project is to provide an automated
capability for government acquisition personnel to receive information on
current and prospective suppliers that reflects the suitability and risks for
investment of taxpayer funds (e.g., supplier capability, capacity, financial
viability, risks). This information might be used throughout the life of
government contracts to understand industrial partners, but may be especially
useful during market research, prior to negotiations, while making contractor
responsibility determinations and prior to exercising contract options.

One of the primary objectives for this project is to integrate prospectus-type
information into contract writing systems, and thus provide information to
contracting personnel within their workflow.  The Internal Revenue Service, for
example, found that acquisition personnel <a

target="_blank">spend hours on each contract award</a> compiling information
and drafting contractor responsibility determinations. For many agencies this
process repeats tens of thousands of times each year. One solution that has
been proposed, and is growing in popularity among multiple agencies, is to
utilize robotic process automation (bots) to screenshot government sites
commonly accessed for responsibility determinations and then e-mail this
information to government buyers. This is an improvement over existing
processes, but only represents a partial solution for providing intelligence on
suppliers.

### Principals that we believe are important:
{: .no_toc }

#### Be informative but be concise.
{: .no_toc }

Contrast to regulations and rules (e.g., FAR).<!-- I was told this may be
insensitive -->

#### Be convenient.
{: .no_toc }

Reduce the need to manually visit and search external sites or otherwise
interact with systems that are outside of the contract writing workflow.  This
means simplifying processes without sacrificing the value of those processes.

#### Don't be cumbersome.
{: .no_toc }

Present contracting personnel with information compiled into a single document,
with outbound links for additional detail.

#### Be accessible.
{: .no_toc }

Information should be universally accessible, meaning (at a minimum) compliance
to [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies)
requirements.
